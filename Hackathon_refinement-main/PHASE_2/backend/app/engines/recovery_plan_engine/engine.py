Recovery Plan Engine Orchestrator

Main entry point for recovery plan generation. Coordinates all components:
- Generator: Creates 3 candidate plans
- Simulator: Simulates each plan's impact
- Scorer: Scores based on simulation results
- Explainer: Generates narrative explanations
- Ranker: Ranks plans and marks "Recommended"

Returns complete ranked list of RecoveryPlan objects ready for API/frontend.
