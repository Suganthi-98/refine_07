Recovery Plan Scorer

Scores recovery plans based on simulated outcomes.

Scoring happens AFTER simulation, not before. A plan's composite score
is NOT the sum of individual recommendation scores (which would double-count
overlapping effects and miss interaction effects). Instead, we run the
actual simulation and read the real resulting state.

Composite score formula (deterministic, no ML):
    0.45 * deadline_probability
    + 0.30 * (1 - normalized_expected_delay_days)
    + 0.15 * (1 - normalized_risk_score)
    - 0.10 * normalized_execution_complexity

The complexity penalty is critical: it stops the system from always
recommending the most aggressive plan. A 7-action plan needs to lose
points relative to a 3-action plan with similar probability, because
the 3-action plan is more likely to actually get executed correctly.
